An MVC Controller Sample in Spring Boot:

* Initial screen when hitting localhost does not have a Controller, so it simply sends the user to a template HTML page
* Note Go Back Links will send you to the previous screen using <a href> to where you navigated from
* Off the HomePage, the Link starts some Controller logic
* Sends you to /twice-baked.html, which has some Mustache substitution for an adjective and degree for what you should cook to
